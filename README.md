# Manual Testing

- I conducted exploratory tests on the following websites:
  - justjoin.it
  - player.pl
  - polsatboxgo.pl
- I created test session reports for these websites.
- I developed a PWA-compliant test plan that included:
  - Assumptions consistent with the principles of PWA
  - Test cases corresponding to the main principles of PWA
- I performed the tests on the pinterest.com application.
- Additionally, I reviewed the technical specifications for the access management IT system at PGE Narodowy:
  - Designed 10 tests
  - Arranged some of them into a test scenario.
