# manual-testing
I conducted exploratory tests on justjoin.it, player.pl, and polsatboxgo.pl, and created test session reports. I developed a PWA-compliant test plan with relevant test cases and tested pinterest.com. Additionally, I reviewed the technical specs for PGE Narodowy's access management system, designing 10 tests and arranging some into a scenario.
